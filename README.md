## General Info
This is an Airbnb clone I created following part II of the Scrimba React course. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Learning Goals
* Build custom components
* Props - mapping over data

## Technologies
* React.JS
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VSCode

## Usage

To get this set up on your local machine:
- Fork then clone this project
- In your terminal:
```
cd airbnb-clone
npm start
```
This will run the app in the development mode. If it doesn't open automatically, go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your broswer.
